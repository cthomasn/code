Position + Velocity: (15.0, 1.5, 5.0)

Subtracting velocity and position vectors together: 
Position - Velocity: (5.0, -8.5, -5.0)

Multiplying velocity and position vectors together: 
Position * Velocity: (50.0, -17.5, 0.0)

Dividing velocity and position vectors together: 
Position / Velocity: (2.0, -0.7, 0.0)
